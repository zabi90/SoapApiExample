# SoapApiExample

### Introduction
The purpose of this sample is to consume SOAP base api using retrofit with xml converter that parse your xml body into plain object.
I used two different XML converters in this example TikXML and Simple XML Converter. Simple XML Converter is deprecated but it sill works that's why i added both in this example.

### Libraries
